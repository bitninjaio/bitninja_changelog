bitninja (3.2.0)
    * MalwareDetection module
        - Added a new signature type: md5-clean.
            - md5-clean signatures will clean malware efficiently during scan phase 1.
            - Currently, user-level md5-clean signatures only.
        - Real-time malware detection can be disabled with the enable\_active\_scan option.
        - The create\_signatures\_during\_phase2 option enables the agent to create
            - md5 and md5-clean signatures during the phase 2 scan.
                - By default, the option is disabled.
        - Added support for inotify versions newer than 3.14.
    * A proxy\_read\_timeout option is now added to the WAFManager module.
        - This is a timeout threshold in the Nginx proxy.
        - If the option was overridden initially in the local Nginx configs, then the agent migrates the overridden value to this option.
    * Added whitelist to SpamDetection for sender scripts.
        - There is an option to add scripts by path or by file name.
        - Whitelisted files will not be flagged as sender scripts.
    * bitninja dispatcher 1.0.1
        - Now can restore API connection if it fails.
        - Logs are now moved under the /var/log/bitninja-dispatcher/ directory.
        - Log rotation is separate. It depends on the log size.
        - The current log is always indicated by current.log.
